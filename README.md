# Custom-deep-learning-model-for-NID-classification


It's totally difficult to anyone to train model with 20 NID images because deep learning model requires sufficient amount of data to build a good classifier model.
But at the end ,mobilenet gives a train and Val acc 100% after 300 epoches.Also took subset of param from mobilenet due to less amount data to get better performances.
